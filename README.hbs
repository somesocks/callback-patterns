# callback-patterns

`callback-patterns` is a collection of design patterns for callback-driven async code.  The design patterns in this library are constructors that build callback-expecting functions.  Each pattern is designed to be a stand-alone piece of code, tested for performance and robustness.

## Design

There is one major difference between this package and many other callback-driven async libraries: **the callback comes first**.

```javascript

// this
function task(callback, arg1, arg2, ...) { }

// not this
function task(arg1, arg2, ..., callback) { }

```

This makes it easier to compose callback-driven functions in useful ways, with almost no boilerplate code.
